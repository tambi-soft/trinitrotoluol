<h4>Import Map</h4>

If the data of a Donor are not known to TntWare, this Donor will not have a Donor-ID. In this case we have to do the mapping between TntWare and trinitrotoluol manually.

As the <b>TNT Memo</b> field in TntWare usually contains a hint to the Donor identity, this would be used to do this mapping.
