<h4>Agreement</h4>

Because of the <b>GDPR</b> you need to have some sort of permission from every person to store some of his/her personal information.
<br>
<br>
You could for example create an email-folder for storing any mails containing such permissions and store in the field <b>agreement</b> the according date to be able to find the permission fastly if needed.
<br>
<br>
If you have your permissions on physical paper, you could leave here a mark like <i>red folder, page 24</i>
<br>
<br>
For the exact handling please consider the regulations and requirements of your country and organization.
