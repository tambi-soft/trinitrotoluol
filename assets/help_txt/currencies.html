<ul>
    <li>The <b>default</b>-Currency should have an Exchange-Rate of <b>1</b></li>
    <li>The Exchange-Rate of any other currency should be specified as a multiplicator in relation to the default Currency</li>
    <p>
        Example:<br>
        If 1 USD = 0.91 EUR, and USD is your default Currency:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>USD</b> would have an Exchange-Rate of <b>1</b>,</li>
            <li><b>EUR</b> would have an Exchange-Rate of <b>0.91</b></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <li>If no Currency has an Exchange-Rate of 1, the uppermost entry is taken as the default one</li>
    <li>If more than one Currency has an Exchange-Rate of 1, the uppermost entry with an Exchange-Rate of 1 would be the default one</li>
</ul>
